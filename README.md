## After compiling everything, use following steps to communicate between instances.


1. Run 2 instances of this application


	**java Main [port] [hostname of this instance] [MTU]**
	
	
	e.g. java Main 5555 test1 9


2. Connect to remote instance


	**connect [ip:port]**
	
	e.g. connect 127.0.0.1:5555
	
	
	If both instances are running on the same machine, you can skip the IP address(connect 5555).

3. Send your message to remote instance.


	**send Test_message**

4. Disconnect when done.


	**disconnect**


Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
